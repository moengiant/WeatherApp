# WeatherApp
 This is a proof of concept using tkinter to create a GUI for a python script
 The script takes an input value in the form of a city name and then grabs json data from open weather map for that city and then displays
 current weather conditions and the temperature
 
 You will need to sign up for a free account at open weather map to get an api key and add it to line 57 in order for the script to work
